# **Digital Course: Git/Versioning. My annotations -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
# **States of a file viewd by git in my words:**
## UNTRACKED: A file that belongs to your workspace but It isn't tracked by the git, this implies that
## the git don't have the commit history (version control) from this file and It need to be added into staging area (Staged) : "git add 'file'". If you want to ignore a untracked file in your version control, you can use the file ".gitignore". But, remember, you need to add and commit the file ".gitignore" to have it's version control too.
## UNMODIFIED: The file is already tracked by the git and it belongs to the last commit (the newest version).
## MODIFIED: The git knows that the file was modified and If you want It in the next commit, you need to use "git add".
## STAGED: The file that you used "git add", cames to this state (staging area), It is ready to be reviwed before the commit.
